Image Steganography – Lock and Key
This repository contains a Python-based project for image steganography, enabling secure hiding and retrieval of secret messages or files within images using the "lock and key" principle. The project offers a simple and intuitive way to encode (lock) sensitive data inside images and decode (unlock) them, providing a practical layer of data security.

Features
Steganography Encoding (Lock):
Hide secret messages or files inside ordinary-looking images without significant visual changes.

Steganography Decoding (Key):
Retrieve and reconstruct the original hidden data from the steganographically protected (locked) images.

User-Friendly Workflow:
Simple Python script with clear function calls and documentation for encoding and decoding processes.

Secure and Practical:
An additional security layer for data transfer and storage, making it useful for privacy-focused tasks, secure communication, or digital watermarking.

How It Works
Lock (Encode):
Select an image (cover image) and the data you wish to hide. The script will embed the data into the image using steganographic techniques.

Key (Decode):
Use the unlocking script to extract the hidden message or file from the steganographed image.

Usage
Run image-steganography-new.py to access encoding and decoding functions.

Provide the required image and/or data file paths as prompted or via function arguments.

The output will be a secure image containing your hidden data, or the original data file/message extracted from a locked image.

Applications
Private messaging and secure data transfer

Digital watermarking

Copyright protection and anti-piracy measures

Educational demonstrations of steganography and cryptography principles

Requirements
Python 3.x

Standard imaging libraries (PIL, numpy, etc.) as detailed in the script

Developed for security, privacy, and educational purposes.
For demonstration or research use only—always ensure responsible and legal use of steganographic technologies.
